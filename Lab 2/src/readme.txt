This is the manual for myshell.

There are three streams for different data, standard input (stdin - 0), standard output (stdout - 1) and 
standard error (stderr - 2). Each stream is responsible for a different job, taking in user data to 
pass to a function, giving user or function output to a designated area and outputting errors to the console 
respectively.
